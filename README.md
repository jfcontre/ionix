# TODO Application with Authorization

## Overview

This project is a full-stack application that provides a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing a list of tasks, or "todos". It includes both a front-end and a back-end module, each responsible for handling their part of the application logic.

The back-end is a server application that handles API requests, performs operations against a database, and includes an authorization layer to ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can perform certain operations.

The front-end is a user interface built with modern web technologies, allowing users to interact with the TODO application in a web browser.

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into two main directories:

- `backend/` - Contains all the server-side code including API endpoints, database models, and authentication logic.
- `frontend/` - Holds the client-side code, crafted with a framework/library such as React for a dynamic user experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with the application, you can navigate to each directory for detailed instructions on how to set up and run the individual parts of the application:

- [Front-end Application](./frontend/README.md)
- [Back-end Server](./backend/README.md)

Please make sure to follow the setup instructions carefully to ensure the application runs smoothly.
